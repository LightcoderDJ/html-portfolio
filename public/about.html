<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, I am Danny Dodd Jr or DJ for short. I am a us citizen born and raised in  the texas panhandle and in West 
  Texas or near the permian basin. I have had many different titles in my 48 years of being on this beautiful planet,
   some of them are Data Entry,Department Manager,Safety Coordinator and office clerk just to name a few. 
   I would say that learning to code and creating this (my first Portfolio) is by far the most interesting step
    I have taken to add another title to my resume. I find coding very interesting and even more so as I progress further 
    into this wonderful field of Web Development. </p>

<p>My Goals are to do well enough to get onboard with some projects and further my knowledge and be able to show my fresh ideas
   and add to a project that will give it a better outcome visually and operationally. Of course this would not be possible without
  team work therefore I will strive to be an asset to my team the same as they are going to be for me. </p>

<p>My ambition is driven by the ability to work from home. I have been on disability for almost a decade now and feel that with
  the knowledge in Web Development, it can help me to return to work and be a part of this world that I used to thrive in as far
   as being in the workforce. Working remotely will give me the ability to feel like I am somebody again, being out of the workforce
    for so long takes a toll on your peronal being and that is why I have a strong ambition to learn coding. </p>
